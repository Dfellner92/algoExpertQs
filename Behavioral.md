### General

- AVOID
    + Being too vague!
        - this includes "how you handled a past situation" or "steps you
          took on a certain project"
    + confrontation, disrespect (duh)

- TRY 
    + Striking balance between
        - Highlighting good qualities about yourself (intellectually curious, can lead projects)
        - Ability to work in team (ability to help others)
    + Answer with stories that highlight the two aforementioned (prepare)
    +

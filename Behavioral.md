### General

- AVOID
    + Being too vague!
        - this includes "how you handled a past situation" or "steps you
          took on a certain project"
    + confrontation, disrespect (duh)

- TRY 
    + Striking balance between
        - Highlighting good qualities about yourself (intellectually curious, can lead projects)
        - Ability to work in team (ability to help others)
    + Answer with stories that highlight the two aforementioned (prepare)
    + If you're being asked about an experience but you've never had it, you could 
      say "I've actually never had that experience, but I can tell you how I would have
      handled it had I been in such a situation."
    + You want a balance between specificity and being too vague
    + Don't ramble

One of the most intense sprints with the Social App involved implementing video calls with webRTC. I was working with a senior engineer to implement the view for the calls, while another engineer with a little more experience than me was ensuring compatibility on the app.js component to ensure we wouldn't have issues with our AWS connection. As a remote company, we try to stay as communicative as possible, but this isn't always the case. During our morning "standups", this other engineer would ensure us he'd always be able to connect to webRTC with no issues with AWS, but about 3/4ths through the sprint, we realized even though he was submitting PRS, he hadn't added in the WebRTC logic. I asked him if he was having trouble at any level with this, and as it turns out he was having trouble with AWS connectivity at the deployed level. While everything he did was in making a valiant effort, had we learned about this earlier in the sprint it would have given us the time to make changes to finish on time. However, in the background, he was doing research on his own time on websocket as an alternative plan. So we pair programmed to implement web socket and he was able to teach me and our senior dev everything we needed for this. However, we did have to extend the sprint another 2 days. But what we did do was, A) establish better communication as a team in dealing with what was a blind spot and B) we all learned about websocket and how it pairs with AWS amplify
